When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To be able to access from where ever I am, let others contribute and share
my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    That gives me more control of when I want to kinda sync remote and local copies

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks - GitHub's clones of another repository
    Clones - A copy of another repository
    Branch - A group of commits

    Forks are to be used when one wants to clone another user's repository and it is
remotely.

	Clones are to be used when one wants to create a local copy of a remote repository
or duplicate a local copy.

	Branches are to be used whenever one feels a need to separate a group of commits
into another group, but it's subjective on how to this separation.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To be able to merge manually and detecting merge conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I find it wouldn't be easier at all, since Git and GitHub take all the hassle of
version control from me. Also it would be harder to collaborate with others. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I'd do that if there's a bug oy an experimental feature and I want to work on it,
run some tests before merging it with master branch.
