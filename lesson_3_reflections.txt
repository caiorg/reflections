When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To be able to access from where ever I am, let others contribute and share
my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    That gives me more control of when I want to kinda sync remote and local copies

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks - GitHub's clones of another repository
    Clones - A copy of another repository
    Branch - A group of commits

    Forks are to be used when one wants to clone another user's repository and it is
remotely.

	Clones are to be used when one wants to create a local copy of a remote repository
or duplicate a local copy.

	Branches are to be used whenever one feels a need to separate a group of commits
into another group, but it's subjective on how to this separation.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To be able to merge manually and detecting merge conflicts.
