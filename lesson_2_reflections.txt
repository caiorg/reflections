What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates necessary data to recognize a folder as a repository. Whitout it
Git have no way to know there's a repository in a that particular place.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	
	Staging area is an intersection of the two, where it'l hold the files added
from the working directory therefore knowing which ones are to be sent to the
repository when a commit is done.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	By adding only needed files per logical change and commiting them before adding
other files.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	Adding experimental features, making changes yet keeping master untouched

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	
	They give me a visual feedback of the commits hierarchy.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	The combination of commits from the two branches. The merge itself is a
commit, so it has parents from both branches.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
